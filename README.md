# Chat-Communication
Msc. IT Mini Proj | Java language
This is a mini project during my Msc. IT course.

This chat communication system consists of a server program and a client program. Transmission of text data between the server and the client is made possible when a connection is established between them by using TCP sockets. This application has been designed to work under any WINDOWS system and under any network using TCP/IP Protocol. This Application apart from sending regular text data can also generate sounds when certain keywords are entered.

Have fun!
